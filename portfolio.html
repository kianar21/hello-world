  <p> This is our interactive fiction game, programmed on python! We decided to use the theme of adventure. The setting is based 
  in egg lagoon and the main goal is to kill the dragon and make it back home safe. The main characters are a troll and a dragon. 
  There are many different routes you can take to win the game but at the end of the day, the main goal is to kill the dragon.<p>
