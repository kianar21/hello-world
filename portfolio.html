    <p> It is a virtual ping pong game where the player can play as many
      times as they want! The device that they are using will vibrate everytime the ball hits the wall in the game.</p>

  <p> This is our interactive fiction game, programmed on python! We decided to use the theme of adventure. The setting is based 
  in egg lagoon and the main goal is to kill the dragon and make it back home safe. The main characters are a troll and a dragon. 
  There are many different routes you can take to win the game but at the end of the day, the main goal is to kill the dragon.<p>

<p> This is my random password generator that my group and I created on canopy. Our code can create any password you would like. You can pick
the amount of passwords you need and the number characters you want in your password as well.<p>

<p> This is our image minipulation project. We used a picture of blake's friend, and was taken in the galapagos islands. Our group 
decided to add 2 different color bacgrounds and/or borders. The disorted image is also slanted but does not appear because of the size on my website.<p>

  <p> The data that was used on my bar graph was Apple vs Microsoft and the stock prices that were made per year. Questions that can be anserwed 
      with our graph are how much money one of the companies made per year or how the stock rises rose/fell.The bar graph represents the 
     difference in the stock prices as well. There could be a bit of unaccuracy because of the stock splits 
      and those are not shown. But this is the average amount of data and stock prices over the years. <p>
